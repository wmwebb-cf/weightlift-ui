xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Web App Pitch
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
=> APP NAME
- Weight lifting journal
=> PITCH
- It's hard to keep track of how many reps you can do for a specified time, or how much you usually deadlift. This app keeps it all organized and tracked for you.
=> MVP
- Users can log in and can create, review, update, and delete data on their workouts.
- Can create the name of the exercise, amount lifted and/or reps completed, date, and region of the body exercise targets.
=> STRETCH
- Ability to upload progress pics by date.
- visualize data of progress over time
===> AVAILABLE COMPONENTS
- Web Component

===> Proposal

What problem does your app solve?
- Accountability - being able to track your workouts
- People who are new to fitness
- Athletes who are trying to follow a fitness plan
Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
- This creates a record of exercises logged by the user, by date, so they can track their performance.
What is the mission statement?
- Helping people track their fitness goals one weight at a time.

===> Features

What features are required for your minimum viable product?
- Users can log in and can create, review, update, and delete data on their workouts.
- Can create the name of the exercise, amount lifted and/or reps completed, date, and region of the body exercise targets.
What features may you wish to put in a future release?
- Recommends exercises for a region of the body
- Scanning machine QR codes to have fast input options for the type of exercise, weight, etc.
- Water tracker
- Save a “workout” as a set of exercises - ie “Arm Day”, “Leg Day”
What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
- Recommend playlists paired with workouts
- Sleep tracking, heart rate

===> Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
React/Redux, Semantic UI, React Strap, Styled Components
- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
TBD
Are you required to pay to use the API?
- No
Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
- Not at this time

===> Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
Newcomers to working out and intermediate athletes
- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
Great idea and will potentially use in the future
- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
Not at this time

===> Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

===> Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
